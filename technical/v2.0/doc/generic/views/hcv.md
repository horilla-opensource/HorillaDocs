# Horilla Card View (HCV)

The `HorillaCardView` class extends Django's `ListView` and is customized for rendering card-based UI elements with filtering, actions, and pagination support. It is a foundational tool for displaying model records as card within the HRMS application.

## Usage Example
Hereâ€™s how to use `HCV` in Horilla:

```python

from horilla_views.generic.cbv.views import HorillaCardView

class Employee(HorillaCardView):
    """
    EmployeeList HCV
    """
    model = Employee
    filter_class = EmployeeFilter
    search_url = reverse_lazy("employees-card")
    details = {
        "image_src": "get_avatar", # img/icon src returning model method
        "title": "{get_full_name}", # title mapping with multiple model attributes
        "subtitle": "{email} <br> {employee_work_info__job_position_id} <br> {offline_online}",
    }
    actions = [
        {
            "action": "Edit",
            "accessibility": "path_to.delete_accessibility",
            "attrs": "href=`{delete_url}`", # delete_url is a method in the model
        }
        
        # `model_method` is any method in the model that return the-
        # url path to perform the action for this scenario

## Key Features

- **Filtering Support**:  
  Filters can be applied via the `filter_class`, and saved filters are cached for later use.

- **Action Accessibility**:  
  Actions can be added to each card, with methods to check whether a user has permission to perform that action.

- **Filter Tag Management**:  
  If `show_filter_tags` is enabled, the view will show tags based on the applied filters, excluding those specified in `filter_keys_to_remove`.

- **Pagination**:  
  The view supports pagination with a default of `50` records per page, adjustable via `records_per_page`.

- **Caching**:  
  Query parameters and filters are cached to allow for easy reapplication of saved filters.
