# **Offboarding**

Offboarding is the process of managing an employee’s departure from a company. It involves various tasks and procedures aimed at ensuring a smooth transition for both the departing employee and the organization. In the context of HR software, offboarding features facilitate and streamline these tasks.

Horilla helps organizations manage departures more effectively, minimize disruptions, and protect the company’s interests while also ensuring a positive experience for departing employees.

## **Exit Process View**

In the Exit process view, Horilla organizes employees based on their offboarding stage and lists tasks required to be completed during the process giving an easy and effective visualization. Managers can track each employee’s progress and ensure tasks are completed on time. Once the employee has completed the offboarding process, Horilla automatically blocks the employee’s credentials.
