# Attendance

The attendance software module is the main tool to track and manage employee attendance. By utilizing the attendance module, employees can seamlessly mark their attendance, incorporating secure and accurate biometric attendance integration alongside the check-in/out system. The module tracks overtime, identifies late arrivals and early departures, and allows for verification of mistaken attendance entries, such as forgetting to check out or exceeding attendance validation conditions defined in the settings.

## **Check-In Check-Out**
Check-in/out is the system that marks attendance activity, used to calculate how much duration the employee works, and from the activities, attendances are created. It tracks all the in-out activities of the employees.

## **Attendance View**
The attendance view manages unvalidated attendance and attendance that contains overtime. The **Validate Attendance** tab shows attendance that needs to be verified, where there may be errors or mistakes. The **Validated Attendance with Overtime** tab shows attendance that has been verified and includes overtime hours. Approving overtime will update the employee's attendance record. The **Validated Attendance** tab contains all the attendance that has been verified.

## **Biometric Devices**
Horilla HRMS seamlessly integrates with biometric devices to efficiently manage attendance records. Users can connect and synchronize attendance data from popular biometric devices, such as ZKTeco and Anviz. Additionally, users can add employees directly to the biometric devices through the Horilla HRMS interface. This process ensures a seamless and sophisticated attendance management system for companies.

This functionality empowers employees to manage their attendance records more efficiently within the Horilla system.

## **Late Come Early Out**
Late come and early out are identified by the check-in/check-out system based on the shift schedules for the day. If an employee checks in after the scheduled shift start time, the attendance is marked as "late come." If an employee leaves before the shift ends, the attendance is marked as "early out."
