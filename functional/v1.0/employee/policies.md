Company policies are a set of guidelines and rules established by an organization to govern the behaviour, actions, and decision-making of its employees. These policies serve several purposes, including ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, promoting a safe and respectful work environment, protecting company assets, and maintaining consistency and fairness in organizational practices. Here the admin can create the company policies and all the employees can access this for reading purposes by clicking the Policies menu marked as 1 under the Employees menu.
